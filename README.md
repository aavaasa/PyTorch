PyTorch AI/ML Projects
This repository is a collection of artificial intelligence and machine learning projects implemented using the PyTorch framework. It is intended for learning, experimentation, and showcasing various neural network architectures.

Repository Structure
Autoencoder/ — Implementation of an autoencoder for data compression and reconstruction tasks.

GAN/ — Generative Adversarial Network for generating new data samples similar to the training data.

NST/ — Neural Style Transfer to apply artistic styles to images using deep learning.

RNN/ — Recurrent Neural Networks for processing sequential data.

Transfer_Learning/ — Using transfer learning to improve model efficiency with pretrained models.

U-NET/ — U-Net architecture for image segmentation tasks.

VAE/ — Variational Autoencoder for data generation and modeling.
